Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.

It is concerned with structures, often finite, that take on discrete values.
inherently interdisciplinary flavour with roots in pure mathematics, and a wide range of applications in networks, algorithms, etc.
also a tool of choice in a host of applications, from computers to telephone call routing.
It has become increasingly important, and that trend continues.
In GATE exam Engineering Mathematics / Discrete Mathematics has weightage 15 % and this is consistent over the years.

Mathematics is a section in which you can score 100% and raise your total score in GATE exam. This section does not require extra efforts even the topics which you learn during graduation are sufficient to clear it. You just need proper study material, books and guidance.

The concept you really need to know about discrete mathematics for computer science are these â€“ followed by some good reference books
