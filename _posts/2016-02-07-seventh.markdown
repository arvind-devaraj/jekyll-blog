 In the present scenario it takes more than just technical grades and perseverance to cherry pick your job profile. This is especially true for engineering graduates as is highlighted in the study conducted by Aspiring minds, a leading employability evaluation and certification company.

The report brings to light the dismal picture of employability amongst our job aspirants. As per the study which surveyed 150000 engineering students who graduated in 2015 from over 650 colleges across the country, 80% of the students are unemployable.

The education system does very little to address this pressing issue. Also organisations around the world have found the need to retain smart and productive talent base to retain their leadership in the dynamic and complex business environment. The obvious response from establishments has been to lay emphasis on vital communication and interpersonal skills in job contenders rather than recruiting and training employees in the said area. The onus then shifts to the job seeker himself.

The findings of the report also reveal that focussing on soft skills proficiency combined with academic score is indeed worth its weight in gold in the current conditions.

A key component for workplace success is to collaborate with a wide set of co- workers and diverse clients. Also one must hone language skills to communicate succinctly. Additionally one must strengthen the link of positive self- concept which is an integral contributor to accomplishments.

In many cases complementing problem solving skills with good mix of attitude, motivation, self- control and time management skills enables individuals to present themselves better and progress up the corporate ladder.

Soft skills improvement requires a different matrix and mind-set altogether. One can take up training courses tailored to specific job requirements. A plethora of options exist both in the online and offline space. Individuals keen to build on their soft skills must also be open to new ideas and new approaches to refine themselves and effect a change in their personalities.

Soft skills are undeniably the major master keys to create a worthwhile future. So be the captain of your ship, chart your course, take methodical steps and explore incredible possibilities.
