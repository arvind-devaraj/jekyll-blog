 Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning which is about learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. It is completely based on artificial nueral network. And as neural network is going to mimic human brain so deep lerning is a kind of mimicring the human brain and the idea behind deep learning is to build learning algorithms that mimic brain. It includes learning in supervised ( like classification) and/or unsupervised (like pattern analysis) manners.Also, deep Learning addresses the problem of learning hierarchical representations with a single algorithm or perhaps with a few algorithms.

Deep learning is implemented with the help of Neural netwoks and the idea or motivation behind the Neural networks is nothing, just biological neuron. Basically, deep learning works with the help of deep network(neural networks with multiple hidden layers) in which each layer of nodes train on a distinct set of features based on the previous layerâ€™s output. It use some form of gradient descent for training via backpropagation(backward propagation of errors). Complexity of the features, which the node can recognize, increases as per the advancement increase into the neural net.
