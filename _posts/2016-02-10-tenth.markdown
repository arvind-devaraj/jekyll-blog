Apache Spark is an emerging platform that has more flexibility than MapReduce but more structure than a basic message passing interface.

It relies on the concept of distributed data structures (what it calls RDDs) and operators. Because Spark is a lower level thing that sits on top of a message passing interface, it has higher level libraries to make it more accessible to data scientists. The Machine Learning library built on top of it is called MLib

Apache Spark is an open-source data processing framework for Big Data Analytics.

It is unified and parallel data processing framework, designed to cover a wide range of big data workloads such as Batch processing, Real-time processing, Stream analytics, Machine learning and Interactive SQL.

Apart from supporting all these workloads in a system, Spark lessens the burden of memory and tools management.

Apache Spark was initially developed in UC Berkeley’s AMP Lab in the year 2009 but was open sourced in 2010 under BSD license. It was donated to Apache Software Foundation in 2013 and became an Apache project since 2014. It is now considered as an alternative to all other big data technologies.

Spark has originally been written in Scala programming language and runs on Java Virtual Machine environment (JVM Environment). It supports multiple programming languages for developing applications, these are – Scala, Java, Python, SQL, and R.
